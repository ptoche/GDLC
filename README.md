## WARNING!

MAY 2020: WORK IN PROGRESS. UNTESTED. HORRIBLE CODE. 

## Overview

Python code to edit an ebook dictionary into a Kindle lookup dictionary that may be associated with the Catalan language. The source files may then be used to rebuild a dictionary. 

**Reader:** _Kindle Paperwhite 2018_ aka Paperwhite 4 (Lookup dictionaries are not supported by all Kindles).

**Source:** _Gran Diccionari de la llengua catalana (Kindle Edition)_. Available for purchase at https://www.amazon.com/Gran-Diccionari-Llengua-Catalana-Catalan-ebook/dp/B00DZWFUG4/ for less than 10 U.S. dollars. A free sample may be requested from amazon. This ebook does not support lookup (it is not listed as a dictionary under the Catalan language). The source was purchased in April 2020 and delivered in mobi format. The mobi file was converted to the azw format with calibre (https://calibre-ebook.com/). The azw file was broken into several components using the KindleUnpack plugin (https://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/KindleUnpack).  

**Software:**  

* Python is free sofware available for most operating systems: https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/. 

* BeautifulSoup is a free Python library: https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/

* KindleGen is free software freely provided by Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&docId=1000765211. 

## Installation

You must be able to run Python 3 code and the BeautifulSoup library. As the files to be processed are large and the content proprietary, online emulators may not be the appropriate tool. You must have a copy of the dictionary. A free sample may be found inside the GDLC directory.
